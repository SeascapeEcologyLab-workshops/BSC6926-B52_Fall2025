#### **Course description and learning outcome:**

This workshop is connected to PCB5423 course, and it will be a co-requisite and will be offered to students enrolled in this course. The workshop is designed to provide an active learning experience by analyzing and illustrating several topics that will be discussed in PCB5423 using ecological models and analytical tools. Specifically, R programming language will be used to learn and implement ecological models and analytical tools and discuss ecological fundamentals using quantitative examples. R is becoming one of the most widely used programming platforms for analyzing and illustrating ecological patterns/data; thus, we hope to introduce novice and beginner coders to this fantastic programming language.

#### **When and where:**

*In-Person Sessions:* Lectures and hands-on programming/modeling exercises will be an integral part of the workshop’s learning experience; thus, most sessions will be based on face-to-face meetings to facilitate learning and assistance during the workshop sessions. In-person sessions will be offered only at BBC.

*Office hours:* Tuesdays and Thursdays, 3:00 – 4:00 pm, or by appointment. Please request a Zoom link by email or pass by my office for office hours meetings. I am constantly in/out of my office since my lab spaces are not in MSB; thus, please send me an email or talk to me after the workshop lectures to set up a meeting at my office.

#### Teaching schedule:

Changes to this schedule and other announcements regarding the course will be posted in CANVAS (sent FIU email addresses only).

**Please bring a laptop to class** so you can follow the R scripts during class and perform workshop exercises. Please, contact us if you do not have access to a laptop

R and R studio are free software environment for statistical computing and graphics required for the workshop. Please download it to your laptops:\

Materials and links on R programming and statistical analyses helpful in learning R and the workshop exercises/homework/project

-    R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham and Garret Grolemund -- An introduction to programming with R: <https://r4ds.had.co.nz/>\
-    Quick-R by datacamp: Quick overview on R programming and statistical approaches.There are more tutorials, but you will be required to register\
-    RStudio Cloud Training Exercises: <https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers>\
-    Virtual Ecology Portal/EcoVirtual R Package: Website that provides various examples of population and community models that will be discussed in class and the workshop. There is also an R package (EcoVirtual) you can use to run various models included on this website: <http://ecovirtual.ib.usp.br/doku.php?id=start>\

#### **Teaching:** 
Lectures and R programming exercises will be part of each workshop session to introduce several topics on population and community modeling and analyses, and provide context to the ecological fundamentals taught in PCB5423. The grade will be based on participation, one homework, and a final project (see below).\

#### **Grading:** 
•	The final grade will be composed of 3 assignments/tasks. These three assignments/tasks are: 1) Class participation (attendance and class exercises), 2) one R exercises homework and 3) group project presentation.\

**Class participation (Total 10 pts)** will count for 25% of your final grade. This grade will consist of attending, participating, and submitting R exercises (0, 1). After each workshop, you will be asked to do and submit the results of a series of R exercises that you will try to answer to the best of your knowledge. Class discussions include asking and answering questions, providing insightful comments and suggestions, and assisting peers.\  

**R homework exercises (Total 50 pts)** will count for 35% of your grade. After all the R "lab"/workshop sessions, students will submit an assignment demonstrating that they have run some of the code in R and understood the outputs of the models. The programming/coding aspect of the homework can be completed as a collective effort of student teams; however, students should independently answer and submit the homework questions. Please submit homework answers as PDFs or Word documents following a Markdown or Quarto format and the R files showing the code used to answer the questions.\  

**Group project presentation/report (Total 50 pts)** will count for 40% of your grade. The class will be divided into six groups of three students, who will work together on a dataset and a set of questions provided by the instructors. The groups will be assigned randomly by the instructors. Groups will present their findings and submit a final summary report (3-5 pages) during the last scheduled workshop. Groups should submit a PDF copy of their presentation and of their report following Quarto format.\ 


#### **Rubric: **
Grade scale is A: 100-90; B: 89-80; C: <79. This is a graduate-level workshop; therefore, if you are enrolled in this course, it is likely because you have a genuine interest in ecological learning and are seeking to advance your academic career. For this reason, I think final grades should be pass (A or B) or no pass (C). I will give students a C (or less) who didn't commit to the work.\

Students will be graded on their performance in the above areas ONLY. Future career plans will have ZERO influence on the grade you receive in this class. Incomplete grades will be considered only under extraordinary circumstances.\

 

#### **Make-up policy: **
I will provide make-up opportunities only when students present valid excuses (e.g., medical/family emergencies, major fieldwork trips, or conferences). Regardless of the reason, please contact me to identify alternative methods for completing course requirements, depending on the type of assignment missed and the severity of missed assignments. Below is a guideline of potential make-up scenarios/methods (Subject to change):
-   *Participation* – Due to the limited number of sessions, I will award a participation point for only one missed session with a validated and accepted excuse.
-   *Homework* – Make-up alternatives only for medical emergencies. The make-up will consist of submitting the homework materials at a later date (e.g., 48-72 hours after the submission deadline), depending on the gravity of the emergency.
